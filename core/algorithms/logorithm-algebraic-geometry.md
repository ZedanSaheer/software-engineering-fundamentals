# Logorithm : Algebraic Geometry

Now I do not usually dwell so hard into mathematics but I found the significance of logarithm in algorithmic optimisation very important for to grasp the idea of the [Big O notation](https://www.notion.so/Big-O-Notation-526304190435423e9e11c723afb0f96a?pvs=21).

Logarithms are the inverses of exponents. They allow us to solve challenging exponential equations, and they are a good excuse to dive deeper into the relationship between a function and its inverse.

Basically all I have to know is that logarithm teaches us how many times you have to multiply a number by itself to get another number, Which helps us in one way define the complexity invovled in the steps of any algorithm.
